\section{Presentation}

The \CoverageBrowser\ tutorial is composed of two pre-compiled examples inspired from the TextEdit sample of the \QtLibrary:
\begin{description}
\item[textedit\_v1.exe] Simple text editor instrumented with code coverage count at the decision/condition level. 
\item[textedit\_v2.exe] Same as for \verb$textedit_v1.exe$ but the code behind the save button is modified.
\item[textedit\_v1.exe.csmes] Instrumentation database of \verb$textedit_v1.exe$. The database contains all information necessary including source code, browser information and execution reports.
\item[textedit\_v2.exe.csmes] Instrumentation database of \verb$textedit_v2.exe$.
\end{description}


This tutorial will show some features of \CoverageBrowser\ but is is not intended for explaining the build procedure of an application.
