TestCocoon - Code Coverage for C++ and C#

TestCocoon is a complete code coverage tool chain for C/C++ and C# programs
available under Apple® Mac OS X, Linux™ or Microsoft® Windows. It analyzes the
performance of a software validation and permits to measure the performance and
optimizes the testing process of a C/C++ or C# applications:
  - Finding untested code sections. 
  - Reducing the amount of tests by finding redundant tests.  With TestCocoon it
    is possible to find which portion of the source code is covered only by one
    execution of a test, and to detect if a new test does not cover more source
    code line than existing tests. 
  - Finding dead code trough displaying the code parts which are never
    executed.  
  - Specially useful for manual testing: TestCocoon is able to calculate the
    optimal execution order of tests which maximize the overall coverage after each
    run. 
  - Also, TestCocoon is able to perform its analysis on a difference of two
    applications.  This permits to find which tests are impacted by a source code
    modification and permits to measure the test quality of a patch or a hot fix. 

TestCocoon can be uses for every testing steps and methodologies (unit tests,
automatic tests, manual white box tests, black box tests, etc…), and permits to
collect and merge the execution reports together.
It is composed of 3 tools: 
  - CoverageScanner, which analyzes, instruments and generates the C/C++ or C#
    application. 
  - CoverageBrowser, which displays and manages the results of the coverage
    analysis. black box interactive tests. 
  - An optional Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2005 & 2008 Add-In which permits to
    generate code coverage configurations from every C/C++ projects created by
    Microsoft® Visual Studio®.
